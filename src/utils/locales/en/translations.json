I have explored both back-end and front-end development, and out of everything I have tried, Java has been the language I have enjoyed the most, although I have not yet had the opportunity to use it in a project. I am motivated to continue learning because I find programming to be a perfect combination of utility and the challenge of solving problems. Furthermore, since I was a child, I have used computers for many things, starting with games, which, over time, sparked my curiosity about technology."
